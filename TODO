* To reach feature-parity with the old code, implement a way to change
  parameters (e.g. cutoff).

* Neighborlists using ghost atoms are somewhat implemented
** neighbor lists need "skin" [This is possible already but Compute
   just sets a zero skin. This must be user-definable because the
   optimal skin dpends on what should be done with the
   box. E.g. lattice MC doesn't need skin at all.]

* Way to optimize box volume and shape in addition to positions
** Simple scaling of abs(a), abs(b) and abs(c) is already possible.

* bulk modulus curves with relaxation
* elastic constants (stiffness tensor)

* All in all the following properties should be calculated for
   different lattices:
** cohesive energy
** lattice constant(s) and atomic positions
** bulk modulus with and without atomic relaxation
** stiffness tensor with and without atomic relaxation
** surface properties
*** relaxation, stress, energy

* make it possible to do this all with different neighbor list methods

* Monte-Carlo
