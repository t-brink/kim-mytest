* Way to optimize box volume and shape in addition to positions

* Non-orthorhombic boxes (easiest with NEIGH_RVEC_F, I guess)

* Small boxes (the minimum image convention I use now only works if
   the box is bigger than the cutoff (or 2*cutoff even?))

* bulk modulus curves with relaxation
* elastic constants (stiffness tensor)

* All in all the following properties should be calculated for
   different lattices:
** cohesive energy
** lattice constant(s) and atomic positions
** bulk modulus with and without atomic relaxation
** stiffness tensor with and without atomic relaxation
** surface properties
*** relaxation, stress, energy

* make it possible to do this all with different neighbor list methods

* clean up class interfaces
** if we can get a non-const reference anyway, we don't need a method
   to get it, just make it public

* Monte-Carlo

* Array1D to match Array2D, Array3D, ...

* Dynamic choice of model
